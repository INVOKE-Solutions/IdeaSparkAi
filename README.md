## To Do's
- [ ] Redeploy code on [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) with **Invoke-Solutions repo** instead of Invoke-Analytics (to account for Org Name change).
- [ ] Refactor code into Classes/functions (updating the API is a chore since the way it is initally written is messy).
- [ ] Update `n` parameter so model produces more than 1 image at a time when OpenAI updates it's documentation (for now, `dall-e-3` [only produces 1 photo at a time, very annoying!](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/images/usage?context=node#:~:text=You%20can%20request%201%20image%20at%20a%20time%20with%20DALL%C2%B7E%203%20(request%20more%20by%20making%20parallel%20requests)%20or%20up%20to%2010%20images%20at%20a%20time%20using%20DALL%C2%B7E%202%20with%20the%20n%20parameter.)).
- [ ] Fine-tuning for digital marketing purposes so images are more suited for Instagram/Facebook ads (optional as may be super expensive!).
